# Medcare
A project with a web app and an android app to help people in case of any kind of medical emergencies. The Android app is for the general users, wherein they can use the one tap feature to call for help in case of emergencies. They can use the app for searching the nearby hospitals and for contacting their personal doctor and booking appointments. The users save their medical profiles in the app and can edit it as well. It comes in handy whenever there is any kind of emergency. It is sent to the hospitals, so that they can make the necessary arrangements for the patient. The users can also use the app for helping someone else whenever any emergency arises. The web app on the other hand, is for the hospitals. The hospitals register themselves and they are shown to the users whenever the user wishes to see the nearby hospitals. Whenever the user presses the emergency button, the hospitals are sent notifications of the emergency, its location and the profile of the patient, saved by user. The hospital checks if they have the necessary arrangements for the patient, then they accept the request and an ambulance is sent to the patient. As soon one hospital accepts a request, the notification is removed for other hospitals and the patient is notified that the ambulance is coming through the app.
